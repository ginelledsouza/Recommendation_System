# Netflix Recommendation System

Netflix is an American over-the-top content platform and production company. Netflix was founded in 1997 and ever since has been bringing to us amazing content be it movies or series. Netflix has proven to be a total stress buster to many of us, especially considering the current pandemic around the world. They provide a vast range of content in various languages, genres, and time. 
May it be classics or modern pictures think about it and you may find it on Netflix.

This repository aims at creating a movie assistant such that you can find several suggestions of must-watch based on the movies of your choice. 
For this, we will use the concept called "Recommender systems".

Recommender systemsÂ are an important class of machine learning that offer suggestions to users based on a degree of relevance. 
It can be categorized as collaborative filtering or a content-based system. We will create both these demonstration models.

- <b>Content-Based Recommendation System</b>:<br>
A content-Based recommender is used to suggest relevant data based on only and only the features of the movie searched. 

- <b>Collaborative Based Recommendation System</b>:<br>
Collaborative filtering is a method of making suggestions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or information from 
many users.
